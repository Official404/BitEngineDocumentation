# Getting Started

## **Introduction**
BitEngine is an engine made for personal use by OfficialNomi.
Altho even if it's made for personal use by OfficialNomi i sill have plans on making it public in the future.

At the moment its closed source and the only place i share what im doing and what is happening to it is here and on my [website](http://nomimatisic.com).

So for the moment this documentation site is for me to remember everything i implement and just to remind me how i use sertain functions.
