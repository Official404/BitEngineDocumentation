# Installation

Currently it is quite easy to install BitEngine
But unfortunately you still have to compile the code by your self because I havent built a working executable you can just donwload.

So for the mement here are the steps to get things going.

### Windows
<br></br>
#### Github Download

Start by cloning the reposatory from Github like this.

```
git clone [BitEngine Github link here]
```

After that you have to initialise and update the submodules. (This step can be done in the first step by adding ```--recursive``` at the end)

```
cd BitEngine
```
```
git submodule init
```
```
git submodule update
```

After this navigate to the scripts folder and launche the ```Setup.bat``` file.
